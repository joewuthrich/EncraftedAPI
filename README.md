# EncraftedAPI
This repository contains the API for developing Encrafted spells.

You can use this, along with the resources at https://docs.encrafted.net and https://javadocs.encrafted.net, to create and submit spells for the server.

If you need help, feel free to ask questions in the discord (https://discord.encrafted.net)!
